                    <h3>Web Servers</h3>
                        <h4>Client</h4>
                            <p> Starting point for this websute is VS Code's HTML boilerplate.  
                                The client used to view and test the website is Firefox on Linux.</p>
                        <h4>Local Access</h4>
                            <p> Accessing the website from a local computer must include the index.html 
                                resource in order to view the homepage.
                                Not specifying the resource "/index.html" would result in 
                                viwing the directory of the file. 
                                In Firefox's Inspector under Network, there is one GET request to an HTML 
                                document; the status code is 200.
                
                        <h4>Server Access</h4>
                            <p> Server access does not need to include index.html as a resource. The reason is that 
                                the file is already the <strong>designated homepage</strong> of the web 
                                server. This file, stored in the root directory, is fetched with a <strong>GET</strong> 
                                request.</p>
                                Firefox's Inspector shows a <strong>status code</strong> 200.
                                This status code means that the request to the server to render the page in the 
                                client was successful. The data received is the HTML (text) of my file.</p>
                            
                            
                            <p> There are four GET requests; only two (for the homepage and the favicon paths) are successful. 
                                The other two GET requests, to the <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> main 
                                files, are unsuccessful because these files do not exist. Thus, the 404 status code.
                                The favicon.ico request is successful, even though I did not create such a file. The response 
                                header shows the request has been <strong>cached</strong> by the <strong>DNS</strong>. This 
                                is likely why the status code is 200, even though no such file exists in the public_html folder 
                                on the server, either.</p>
                        <h4>URL</h4>
                            <p> The URL for this website is "https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~dushanol/a1-dushanol/index.html".
                                The <strong>protocol</strong> is "HTTPS" or encrypted HTTP. There are two 
                                <strong>subdomains</strong>, "web" and "engr". The <strong>domain</strong> is 
                                "oregonstate.edu". The <strong>path to the resource</strong> is 
                                "~dushanol/a1-dushanol". And finally, the <strong>resource</strong> is "index.html" 
                                or the homepage.</p>

                    <h3>Frontend Design</h3>
                        <h4>What is Frontend Design</h4>
                            <p>Frontend design focuses on the interaction with the user. Often referred to as User Interface
                                (UI) or User Experience (UX), this field focuses on visual design which enables usability. 
                            </p>
                        <h4>Usability</h4>
                            <p>A guide to reaching ultimate usability of a website consists of the following (known as the
                                the five <strong><q>E</q>s</strong>):
                                    <dl>
                                        <dt><em>Effective</em></dt>    
                                        <dd>Helps users meet their goals.</dd>
                                        <dt><em>Efficient</em></dt>
                                        <dd>Tasks are performed in the fewest number of steps.</dd>
                                        <dt><em>Easy to navigate</em></dt>
                                        <dd>First-time users, especially, locate their goals quickly.</dd>
                                        <dt><em>Error-free</em></dt>
                                        <dd>Study and remove roadblocks for specific users.</dd>
                                        <dt><em>Engaging</em></dt>
                                        <dd>Meet the needs of the intended audience.</dd>
                                      </dl>
                            </p>
                        <h4>Page Layout Tags</h4>
                            <p>Page layout tags are used to section off content. Each tag usually has a content block so 
                                that a line break comes before and after. </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>&lt;main&gt; is the primary block that holds content.</li>
                                        <li>&lt;body&gt; displays the contents of the browser's <strong>viewport</strong> and can 
                                        appear only once on a page.</li>
                                        <li>&lt;section&gt; is a thematic grouping of content with an &lt;h1&gt; heading.</li>
                                        <li>&lt;article&gt; is a specific topic inside a &lt;section&gt; with &lt;h2&gt; heading.</li>
                                        <li>&lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h6&gt; are <strong>hierarchical</strong> headlines which allow screen readers and 
                                            search engines access and use the page's structure.</li>
                                        <li>&lt;footer&gt; is below the &lt;/main&gt; tag and contains legal and contact information.</li>
                                    </ul>    
                        <h4>Anchors</h4>
                            <p><strong>Hyperlinks</strong> from one item to another can be created using &lt;a&gt; the anchor element.
                                This element can hyperlinks to:
                            </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Internal content using IDs <q>&lt;article id="Web Servers"&gt;Web Servers/article>&gt;</q>, 
                                        which results in <article id="Web Servers"></article> <a href="#Web Servers">Web Servers</a></li>
                                    <li>External content using <q>&lt;a href="https://github.com/"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;</q>, which results in
                                    <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a></li>
                                    <li>Page-to-page sing &lt;nav&gt; and &lt;a&gt; before the &lt;header&gt;, which with a css file 
                                        creates buttons to other pages.</li>
                                </ol>

                    <h3>Web Servers</h3>
                        <h4>Client</h4>
                            <p> The starting point for this website is VS Code's HTML boilerplate.  
                                The client used to view and test the website is Firefox on Linux.</p>
                        <h4>Local Access</h4>
                            <p> Accessing the website from a local computer must include the index.html 
                                resource in order to view the homepage.
                                Not specifying the resource "/index.html" brings up the directory of the file. 
                                In Firefox's Inspector under Network, there is one GET request to an HTML 
                                document; the status code is 200.
                
                        <h4>Server Access</h4>
                            <p> Server access need not include the index.html resource because 
                                the file is already the <strong>designated homepage</strong> of the web 
                                server. This file, stored in the root directory, is fetched with a <strong>GET</strong> 
                                request.</p>
                                The Inspector shows a <strong>status code</strong> 200.
                                This status code means that the request to the server to render the page in the 
                                client was successful. The data received is the HTML (text) of the file.</p>
                            
                            
                            <p> There are four GET requests; only two paths (homepage and favicon) are successful. 
                                The other two GET requests, to the <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> main 
                                files, are unsuccessful (status code 404) because these files do not exist.
                                The favicon.ico request is successful. The response 
                                header shows the request has been <strong>cached</strong> by the <strong>DNS</strong>. 
                                Due to the cache, 
                                the status code is 200, even though no such file exists in the public_html folder 
                                on the server.</p>
                        <h4>URL</h4>
                            <p> The homepage URL is "https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~dushanol/a2-dushanol/index.html".
                                The <strong>protocol</strong> is "HTTPS" or encrypted HTTP. There are two 
                                <strong>subdomains</strong>, "web" and "engr". The <strong>domain</strong> is 
                                "oregonstate.edu". The <strong>path to the resource</strong> is 
                                "~dushanol/a1-dushanol". And finally, the <strong>resource</strong> is "index.html" 
                                or the homepage.</p>

                    <h3>Frontend Design</h3>
                        <h4>What is Frontend Design</h4>
                            <p>Frontend design focuses on the interaction with the user. Often referred to as User Interface
                                (UI) or User Experience (UX), this field focuses on visual design which enables usability. 
                            </p>
                        <h4>Usability</h4>
                            <p>A guide to reaching ultimate usability of a website consists of the following (known as
                                the five <strong><q>E</q>s</strong>):
                                    <dl>
                                        <dt><em>Effective</em></dt>    
                                        <dd>Helps users meet their goals.</dd>
                                        <dt><em>Efficient</em></dt>
                                        <dd>Tasks are performed in the fewest number of steps.</dd>
                                        <dt><em>Easy to navigate</em></dt>
                                        <dd>First-time users, especially, locate their goals quickly.</dd>
                                        <dt><em>Error-free</em></dt>
                                        <dd>Study and remove roadblocks for specific users.</dd>
                                        <dt><em>Engaging</em></dt>
                                        <dd>Meet the needs of the intended audience.</dd>
                                      </dl>
                            </p>
                        <h4>Page Layout Tags</h4>
                            <p>Page layout tags are used to section off content. Each tag usually has a content block so 
                                that a line break comes before and after. </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>&lt;main&gt; is the primary block that holds content.</li>
                                        <li>&lt;body&gt; displays the contents of the browser's <strong>viewport</strong> and can 
                                        appear only once on a page.</li>
                                        <li>&lt;section&gt; is a thematic grouping of content with an &lt;h1&gt; heading.</li>
                                        <li>&lt;article&gt; is a specific topic inside a &lt;section&gt; with &lt;h2&gt; heading.</li>
                                        <li>&lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h6&gt; are <strong>hierarchical</strong> headlines, which allow screen readers and 
                                            search engines access and use the page's structure.</li>
                                        <li>&lt;footer&gt; is below the &lt;/main&gt; tag and contains legal and contact information.</li>
                                    </ul>    
                        <h4>Anchors</h4>

                    <h3>Optimizing Images</h3>
                        <p> Image optimization is a common practice in web development. Optimization
                        reduces load time for images in the browser and conserves server space.
                        There are six main optimization specifications: descriptive file naming, 
                        small file size, reducing dimensions, ensuring a correct file format,
                        reducing the image resolution, and choosing an appropriate color mode.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Descriptive File Naming</h4>
                            <p> Ideally, the name of the image file will include who, what, where,
                                and when. Such titles improve search engine optimization, so search
                                engine bots can categorize properly a given image on the web.</p>
                        <h4>Small File Size</h4>
                            <p> The smaller the image file size, the faster it will load. Known as 
                                <strong>compression</strong>, removing data image via 
                                approximations, in turn reduces the file size. Such compression, 
                                however, may result in pixelation and is known as <strong>lossy</strong> 
                                compression. <strong>Lossless</strong> compression, on the other hand,
                                does not degrade the image quality, but it also does not compress the file 
                                size as much as lossy compression.

                            </p>
                
                        <h4>Reducing Dimensions</h4>
                            <p> Images should be cropped to fit the spaces in a given web page. Most 
                                webpages comfortably fit a 600-pixel wide image.</p>

 
                        <h4>Correct File Format</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Online images are usually in <strong>.JPG</strong> (also <strong>.JPEG</strong>) 
                                    format. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group. It is a commonly used 
                                    lossy form of compression, which came about in 1992.</li>
                                <li>Logos and icons are typically in <strong>.GIF</strong> format, which stands for 
                                    Graphics Interchange Format, a bitmap image developed in the '80s.</li> 
                                <li>Graphics, or designs on some surface, are typically in 24-bit <strong>.PNG</strong> format, which 
                                    stands for Portable Network Graphics, a format which supports lossless compression. 
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Reducing the Resolution</h4>
                            <p> How a picture shows up on a monitor is decided by the monitor's pixel-per-inch (ppi) support.
                                Modern monitors support 300+ ppi, but because of variation, it is best to provide multiple image
                                sizes.   
                            </p>
                        
                            <h4>Color Modes</h4>
                            <p> The main color modes are: JPG, WebP, PNG, SVG, and GIF.      
                            </p>
                    <h3>Favicons</h3>
                            <p>Favicons, also known as touch icons, are a quick way to identify a browser tab.
                                Favicons can be saved as .GIF, .PNG, .ICO, and .SVG files. 
                                To create a favicon, all that is needed is a symbol, which is modified to fit
                                different browsers. A favicon is a square, so it is best to come up with a symbol
                                that firs well within a square and is readable. The favicon for this website, for example,
                                is a terminal with a ">" prompt and a made up command "l".
                            </p>

                            <p>Favicons can be used to appear not only on browsers tabs, but also on a smartwatch, 
                                a cellphone, or even in engine search results. Because of all of these formats, 
                                a generator tool can produce appropriate formats for say Chrome on an Android device 
                                or Chrome on a personal computer.

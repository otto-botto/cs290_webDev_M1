    <h2>Web Dev Concepts</h2>

    <p> For this assignment, I used VS Code's HTML boilerplate to draft my website. The client 
        I used is Firefox on Linux.</p>
    
    <p> Accessing the website from my local computer, I must include the index.html 
        resource in order to view the homepage.
        Without specifying the resource "/index.html", I would simply view the directory 
        of the file. 
        In Firefox's Inspector under Network, there is one GET request to an HTML 
        document; the status code is 200.

    
    <p> I do not need to include index.html as a resource when accessing the website via the 
        server, because the file is already the <strong>designated homepage</strong> of a web 
        server. This file, stored in the root directory, is fetched with a <strong>GET</strong> 
        request.</p>
        Firefox's Inspector shows a <strong>status code</strong> 200.
        This status code means that the request to the server to render the page in the 
        client was successful. The data received is the HTML (text) of my file.</p>
    
    
    <p> There are four GET requests; only two (for the homepage and the favicon paths) are successful. 
        The other two GET requests, to the <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> main 
        files, are unsuccessful because these files do not exist. Thus, the 404 status code.
        The favicon.ico request is successful, even though I did not create such a file. The response 
        header shows the request has been <strong>cached</strong> by the <strong>DNS</strong>. This 
        is likely why the status code is 200, even though no such file exists in the public_html folder 
        on the server, either.</p>
    
    <p> The URL for my website is "https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~dushanol/a1-dushanol/index.html".
        The <strong>protocol</strong> is "HTTPS" or encrypted HTTP. There are two 
        <strong>subdomains</strong>, "web" and "engr". The <strong>domain</strong> is 
        "oregonstate.edu". The <strong>path to the resource</strong> is 
        "~dushanol/a1-dushanol". And finally, the <strong>resource</strong> is "index.html" 
        or the homepage.</p>
